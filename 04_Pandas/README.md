# Data Analysis - The game company, Pymoli

## Background 
As Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company, I've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.<br>
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like me to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
<br>
## Three Observable trends based on the data
1. Gender<br>
  A 84% majority of players are male with just 14% female. Even though there's far fewer female player, their average spend is actually ~10% higher than for males.<br>
  <br>
1. Age Demographics<br>
  Outside from the two main age demographics of 15-19 and 20-24, the other age groups still spend about the same on average. In fact, the two highest spending groups are actually 30-34 (avg total  4.76)𝑎𝑛𝑑<10(𝑎𝑣𝑔𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙  4.54).<br>
  <br>
1. Items<br>
  Purchases are evenly spread out among many people. The top spender only purchased 5 items(total $ 18). Also, for items, the most popular item was purchased only 12 times. 4/5 most people items are also the most profitable.<br>
